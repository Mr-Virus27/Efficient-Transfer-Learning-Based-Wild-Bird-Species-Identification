# Efficient-Transfer-Learning-Based-Wild-Bird-Species-Identification
This project uses transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs to efficiently identify wild bird species from images. By leveraging existing models, it achieves high accuracy with limited data, reducing training time and computational resources. The system aids wildlife monitoring, research, and conservation efforts.
